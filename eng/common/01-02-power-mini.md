## Power Supply

The main power source of the product is a DC power adapter with (10÷14) V output.

The Li-Ion 18650 battery with 3.7 V rated voltage can be used as a backup power source.

The product provides automatic maintenance of the installed battery, which includes the following:

* subsequent charge of the discharged battery with a current of (100±25) mA;
* ability to automatically turn off the discharged battery in the absence of the main power supply when the voltage on it reaches (3.5±0.1) V;
* stability to both the break and short circuit in the battery circuit is unlimited in time, while the product will be powered from the main source;
* protection against "reverse polarity" in case of wrong connection to the battery terminals or external UPS.

If an external UPS is used as a backup power source. Extermal UPS must be connected instead of main power source. The product continues to periodically monitor the fact of its connection, but does not monitor the presence, condition and charge of its backup battery.
