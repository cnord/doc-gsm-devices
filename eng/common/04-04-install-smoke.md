## Connection of Fire Detectors

### Four-wire Fire Detectors

The signal cables to which the four-wire fire detectors are connected are connected to the terminals "Z1"-"Z8".

The common zone cables are connected to the “GND” terminals.

If it is necessary to reset the power of the fire detectors after an alarm, the plus power cable of the zone shall be connected to the SMOKE terminal. In this case, after the alarm repetition interval is over (see section "Configuration"), the power supply from the detectors will be switched off for a short time.

If resetting the power of the fire detectors is not required, the plus power cable of the fire zone shall be connected to the PWR terminal. 

### Two-wire Fire Detectors

Two-wire _smoke_ fire detectors are connected to the device only through the matcher "EFW-2", which allows connection of two-wire detectors according to four-wire circuit.
