## Ethernet {#config-eth}

The tab is used to display and change the connection settings over the Ethernet network.

The "Ethernet" tab is displayed in the configurator only if the "Ethernet Adapter" is connected to the device.

The tab displays the MAC address that is used by the Ethernet Adapter. This information can be useful if the settings for connecting to a public network are set individually for each device.

Besides, if the network to which the device is connected does not have a DHCP server that automatically configures the network connection settings, you can manually set these parameters by explicitly specifying the IP address that the device shall use, the subnet mask to which it belongs, IP address of the gateway to be used to access the public network, as well as the IP addresses of the DNS servers.
