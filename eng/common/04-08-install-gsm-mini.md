## GSM Channel Setting

The device is equipped with an built-in GSM-modem, which can work alternately with one of the two installed SIM-cards.

### SIM Card Installation

\imgcapt{img/channel-switch-button-mini.png}{SIM Cards Installation}

The SIM card holder is located on the middle part of the device board.

The main SIM-card (SIM1) is below, the reserve on (SIM2) is on top. SIM-cards are installed in the holder with the contact pad towards the board. Before installing SIM-cards in the device, completely disconnect it, otherwise the SIM-card can be disabled by static electricity.

Do not forget to turn off the PIN code request. If the PIN code is not disabled: firstly, the device will not be able to use this SIM card; secondly, the SIM card can be blocked after several activation attempts.

If you use only one SIM card, be sure to install it in the slot for the main SIM card - closer to the card.

### Check of GSM Signal Level

Before starting the device, it is essential to check the signal level at the intended installation site. This can be done with the HL1 LED on the left side of the device board or with the Hubble Configurator â€œState panel" tab. For more information on checking the communication channels, see section 5.14.

If the GSM signal level is weak, it is necessary to move the device to another location, or to install a remote GSM antenna.

### Connection of Remote GSM Antenna

To connect the remote antenna instead of the internal antenna, it is necessary to perform the following:

* remove the device board from the case by unscrewing the fixing screws;
* replace the internal antenna with a remote antenna;
* check that the board with the installed remote antenna fits tightly to the posts;
* if necessary, drill a 10 mm hole in the body to bring the antenna feeder out. In this case, first it is necessary to pass the antenna feeder through the hole in the case and then screw it to the connector on the board;
* install the board in the case by fastening the mounting screws.

Before final securing of the external antenna to a permanent installation site, it is necessary to check the signal level on both SIMs at this particular location. If the signal level is not satisfactory, move the antenna to a different location.

Recommendations for installation of the external antenna:

* move away from the device at a distance of at least 50 cm;
* do not coil the antenna feeder;
* mount the antenna on the dielectric surface;
* mount the antenna in a vertical position.
