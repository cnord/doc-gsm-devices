## Connection of Temperature Sensors {#install-temp}

The wired temperature sensor is connected to the "Reader" terminal group. The black and red wires coming from the sensor shall be twisted together and connected to the "GND" terminal, and the yellow wire to the "DATA" terminal - as shown in the picture below. If it is necessary to connect several wired temperature sensors, then all of them shall be connected in parallel to each other.   
In order for the device to detect a wired temperature sensor, it is necessary to turn on the mode of constant polling of the 1-Wire interface in the device settings. It is possible to do this on the "Miscellaneous" tab in the [Control and indication] section (#control-indication).

It is possible to connect a wired sensor to the wireless temperature sensor CN-Celsius.
