# Device Configuration {#config-info}

A special configurator, called “Hubble”, is used to configure (change settings of) the device.

The current version of the configurator can be downloaded from the official support site of C.Nord company ([support.cnord.ru](http://support.cnord.ru)), from page «[Files for download](https://support.cnord.ru/hc/ru/articles/203372340)».

The configurator is supplied as a zip-archive with the name **hubble-X.XX.zip**, where **X.XX** is digits corresponding to the configurator version. Unpack the archive to the hard drive of the computer, preferably - to the root folder. 

> If you cannot unzip the archive to the root of the disk for some reason, unpack it to a folder in the name of which there are no Cyrillic symbols and spaces. If this condition is not met, then the device configurator will not work correctly. 

The executable configurator file is called **hubble.exe**, this file shall be run to change the device settings.

> The Hubble configurator is intended for changing the settings of the following devices: “Nord GSM”, “Nord RF”, “Nord LAN”, “Soyuz GSM”, “Soyuz PCB GSM”, “ТР-100 GSM IV” and “Serzhant GSM”.   

To start configuring the device, it is necessary to connect it to the computer via USB and run the configurator. In order for the configurator to be more convenient to run, it is recommended to place a shortcut for launching it on the desktop or in a folder of frequently used programs.

After the configurator is started, it automatically detects the device connected to the computer, checks the software version installed on the device, and loads the device settings.

If the version of the software installed on the device does not match the version required for the configurator, an error message will be displayed asking you to update the software on the device. In this case, it is necessary to shut down the configurator and update the software on the device as described in the ["Software Update”](#firmware-update) section.
