## Notification Channels

The product notifications can be sent by the following independent communication channels:

* via GSM 900/1800 cellular networks of two different carriers through the built-in GSM-modem;
* via Ethernet network using the optional "Ethernet Adapter" module, which is installed in the product and connected to the dedicated socket of the product main board;
* via the radio channel in the midband, VHF, UHF bands with the help of an optional radio transmitter connected to the interface connector "TR-100 OUT" of the product (for 
the product in a metal case).

The product in a plastic case is equipped with a small GSM stub antenna without a feeder with an angular connector of SMA-male type, connected to the connector type of SMA-female type. For products in a plastic case, it is possible to connect a remote dipole antenna (with a connector of the same type) to improve the communication quality with the base station of the carrier. The product in a metal case is equipped exclusively with a remote dipole antenna.

To transmit events to the monitoring panel, the device can use the following communication channels:

* GPRS;
* VOICE (voice channel with DTMF-encoding);
* SMS.

In the mode of packet transmission of notifications (GPRS), the content is encrypted.

The device has a two-tier SIM-card holder, in which it is possible to install two SIMs of different carriers. The active SIM is selected automatically, in accordance with the established algorithm of the cellular communication module. In addition, there is an unconditional transfer to another SIM when the user presses a button installed next to the SIM holder.

The device can estimate the signal level in the carrier networks at the device installation site separately for each of the two SIMs and display the received result in the configurator interface.
