## Cloud {#config-cloud}

Connecting the device to the "Cloud" provides the service functions of the device and allows to interact with it remotely with the help of the "MyAlarm" mobile application and the “Engineering panel” service. A detailed description of the technology can be found in [Remote Access to Device](#remote-access) section.

On the "Cloud" tab it is possible to choose to which "Cloud" the device shall be connected. 

If you use the public “C.Nord Cloud" for work, then everything is simple - you need to click the button with the same name:

If the device shall work with the “Private Cloud”, then click the "Private Cloud" button, and then enter the pin code which you received when configuring your "Private Cloud":

If the “Private Cloud” server pin is entered correctly, when you click the button with a “tick”  the name of the “Private Cloud corresponding” to the pin code is displayed instead of the input field:

If for some reason you need to configure the settings for connecting to the Private Cloud manually, then this option is also available: you need to click the "Configure manually" button and specify the addresses and ports to connect to the "Cloud" via GPRS and Ethernet (displayed only if the Ethernet adapter is connected to the device):
