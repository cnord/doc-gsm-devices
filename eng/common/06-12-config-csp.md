By default, the configurator lists the most common carriers. Before starting the device via GSM it is important to make sure that the parameters of the SIM card used in the device are indicated.
If there are no parameters for the selected carrier in the listed blocks, it is necessary to specify them manually, by filling in the fields _Name, PLMN, Access Point, Username, Password_. All these parameters can be requested by the device from the SIM card during registration in the network.
