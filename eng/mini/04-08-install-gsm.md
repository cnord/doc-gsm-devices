## GSM Channel Setting

The device is equipped with an built-in GSM-modem, which can work alternately with one of the two installed SIM-cards.

### SIM Card Installation

\imgcapt{img/04-08-sim-install-mini.png}{SIM Cards Installation}

The SIM card holder is located on the middle part of the device board.

The main SIM-card (SIM1) is below, the reserve on (SIM2) is on top. SIM-cards are installed in the holder with the contact pad towards the board. Before installing SIM-cards in the device, completely disconnect it, otherwise the SIM-card can be disabled by static electricity.

Do not forget to turn off the PIN code request. If the PIN code is not disabled: firstly, the device will not be able to use this SIM card; secondly, the SIM card can be blocked after several activation attempts.

If you use only one SIM card, be sure to install it in the slot for the main SIM card - closer to the card.

### Connection of Remote GSM Antenna

Recommendations for installation of the external antenna:

* move away from the device at a distance of at least 50 cm;
* do not coil the antenna feeder;
* mount the antenna on the dielectric surface;
* mount the antenna in a vertical position.
