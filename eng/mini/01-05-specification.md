## Main Technical Characteristics

* The minimum number of the product wired security zones, designed to connect different detectors, is 4;
* The maximum allowable total resistance of two wires of each zone - no more than 330 Om;
* The number of wireless (stand-alone) terminal units supported by the product when installing the radio channel signaling zone extension unit CN-WRL is up to 31;
* For joint operation with the product in the version of the "Nord GSM Mini" (with the installed radio expander CN-WRL), the following radio channel terminal units can be used:
	* manual security detector «CN-KeyFob»;
	* volume electro-optical security detector «CN-PIR»;
	* volume electro-optical street security detector «CN-PIR-Outdoor»;
	* manual security detector magnetic contact «CN-Magnetic»;
	* surface sound security detector «CN-Glass»;
	* fire detector «CN-Smoke»;
	* manual fire detector «CN-Fire»;
	* flooding detector «CN-Flood»;
	* temperature detector «CN-Celsius»;
	* notification repeater «CN-Repeater»;
	* siren «CN-Siren»;
	* keypad “CN-Keypad”.

	> The optional radio expander CN-WRL is connected to the product main board by means of a special 4-pin connector via RS-232 v.24 interface (with TTL logic signal levels), and the radio extender is powered through the same connector.

* The maximum number of wired zone states controlled by the product is four ("norm", "alarm", "break", "closing"). In this case, the type of each of the organized zones is normally closed or normally open, as well as the number of termination resistors, with one or two termination resistors - is set by the user when configuring the product;
* The product allows connection of four-wire fire sensors to the security wired zones, providing the possibility of their automatic restart (alarm reset) by switching in their power lines. 
* The maximum current consumption of all wired sensors connected to the product is limited by the value of self recovering thermal switch and shall not exceed 200 mA;
* The product is equipped with a microswitch installed on its board, which acts as a tamper switch.

	> In addition, it is possible to install a terminal block on the board to connect an external tamper switch (for the product version in a metal case);
	
* The product has non-volatile memory for storing messages generated by it;
* The product provides support for the 1-Wire protocol in the rank of "master" on the connector of the corresponding interface, allowing its arming and disarming, for example, with the help of devices of the DS1990A series, connecting remote temperature sensors, hardware devices for expanding the controller ports, etc. (support of different device on the 1-Wire bus is determined by the software version of the product controller). The "LED" line of the 1-Wire interface is short-circuit protected and is designed to connect an external LED indicating the product status, with a current consumption of up to 8 mA (for example, LED located in the TM reader);
* A piezoelectric siren can be connected to the product for sound confirmation of the "Alarm" state with a current consumption up to 200 mA, at the same time the product detects such malfunctions in its connection circuit as a break and short circuit, both in the absence and in the presence of “Alarm” signal. The output for the siren connection is protected by the self recovering thermal switch;
* The product has seven controlled discrete outputs of "open collector” type, allowing connecting the switched load to the product, for example, electromagnetic relays, acoustic or electrooptical devices. The maximum allowable sink load current of discrete outputs is 500 mA; the maximum permissible DC voltage supplied to the outputs is plus 50 V;
* The main board is equipped with a multifunctional three-color process LED designed to display the current state of the product and the estimated values of some of the parameters monitored by it;
* The product provides voice support to the user (maintenance staff) by playing audio files through the built-in speaker if problems are detected that prevent the normal operation of the product, for example, when troubleshooting security zones with the specification of the failure nature and location, reaching a negative balance of the bill for security services, etc. 
* The product is equipped with a vertical connector of the "mini USB B" type for its configuration after connecting to the computer USB port;
* By means of special software it is possible to remotely change the product configuration parameters, as well as update the controller software;
* The product is designed for continuous (twenty-four-hour) operation in the operating temperature range (without taking into account the temperature limitations of the backup power supply) from -20°C to +50°C;
	
	> The permissible product operating temperature range with a backup source is determined by the characteristics of the battery installed in it, and first of all by the maximum permissible temperature values during charging.

* Overall dimensions of the plastic case, mm, maximum, - 150x96x32;
* The product weight in a plastic case (without a backup power source, power cord and packaging), kg, maximum, - 0,2;
