To create a partition, click the “Add partition” button. Each partition is assigned its own number, the numbers are given sequentially from 1 to 32.
Each partition has the "Add zone" and "Add code” buttons located in the second and third column respectively.

Use the "Add zone" button in the drop-down menu to select the zones that will be added to this partition. The drop-down menu displays only *enabled* zones.

Use the recycle bin icon to delete previously created partitions.

### Partition Management

In order for a user to use his or her personal code during the partition arming or disarming, the user shall be mapped to this partition. To do this, click the "Add code" button and select those users from the drop-down list who will be able to manage a particular partition.

If a user has a TM-key and wants to manage partitions with it, they also shall be added to the selected partition.

It is important to consider the following:

* If the TM-key or keyfob is not added to any partition, it will be automatically assigned to the first partition.
* One keyfob cannot manage several partitions, only one. The same situation is with a TM-key: only one partition can correspond to one key.
* One user can be assigned to several partitions. In this case, for arming or disarming, the user will have to specify the number of the partition that he/she is going to arm or disarm.
* The same zone can be added to several partitions, but remember that the zone is armed when all partitions into which it is included are armed.
