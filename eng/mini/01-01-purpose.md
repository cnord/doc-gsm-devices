## Purpose and Capabilities

The "Nord GSM Mini" device is intended for operation as the head unit of the security and fire complex - the receiving and monitoring security and fire alarm device (PKKOP), installed in the premises at the protected sites.

Various wired and wireless security, fire and process detectors and devices can be connected to the device. An optional CN-WRL wireless expander is used to connect wireless devices.

The device can generate and transmit to the control panel messages about events occurring during its operation and related to:

* the device arming or disarming;
* changes in the state of its security zones;
* changes in the state of its power sources (main and backup);
* disruptions in the operation of communication channels used by the product and other malfunctions;
* activation and restoration of the state of the housing tamper switch.

The device transmits notifications to the receiver using the built-in GSM/GPRS-communicator via voice channel, SMS or GPRS. It is possible to transmit messages over the Ethernet network using the optional Ethernet Adapter module installed in the product, as well as via the radio channel using the midrange, VHF or UHF radio transmitter installed in the product.
 
The device is equipped with uninterrupted power supply and automatically maintains its backup power source installed in its case during its entire operating life. The product is capable of providing power supply to the connected communication modules (communicators) and devices for expanding its functionality within the limits of permissible consumed capacities.
