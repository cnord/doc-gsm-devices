## Users

On the "Users" tab, the users of the site are created. It is possible to create up to 32 users in the device, and each user, in addition to personal code, can also have TM-keys.

To create a new user, it is necessary to click the _Add user_ button and enter the code in the new window, which the user will use when arming or disarming the site.

To add a Touch Memory key, click the **Scan** button in the "Keys" column, then attach the TM-key to the reader. If the reader is connected correctly, the key code will be displayed. 
It is possible to manually add a TM-key. To do this, press the button **Enter the number** and enter information from the key in the new window.

Next, go to the [Partitions](# 06-06-config-parts) tab and add the key to the partition it will control. One user can have several TM-keys, but a single TM-key can control the state of only one partition.
